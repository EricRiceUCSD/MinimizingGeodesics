# Curves of Minimal Length and Energy on Manifolds: Geodesics and Their Approximations
Source code for Math 273C final project on optimization on manifolds

Running Sphere.py or Torus.py will approximate the geodesic between two points P and Q on the sphere S^2 or the torus T^2, respectively.  P and Q are determined by their coordinate representations p and q, given as parameters at the top of each file.  The file must be in the same directory as ApproximationFuncs.py.

Required packages are
- numpy (for array and matrix operations)
- matplotlib (for graphing)
- Axes3D from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d (for 3D plots)
